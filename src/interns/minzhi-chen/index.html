        Hi, my name is Minzhi Chen and I am from the University of Michigan, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I love computer science and software engineering because I think it has become the new global language where many people can communicate with each other and share insightful ideas and working as a software engineer makes me learn new knowledge everyday which makes my life more interesting and exciting! I would love to intern at Lob to gain hands-on software engineering project experience and familiarize myself with the development process. Besides, I love Lob's collaborative culture, which makes a perfect environment for me to learn from peers and have wonderful mentorship through the internship program.Last but not least, I would love to return to the Lob company as a full-time engineer after the internship.
